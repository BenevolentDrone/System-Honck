# System-Honck
A game for Ludum Dare 45

It's a lovely morning in the mainframe, and you are a horrible viroose. Play as a virus disguised as a digital goose and ruin the mainframe's AI day by pushing it to the point of self destruction.


## Controls:

WASD - movement

Space - dedicated HONK button

F - flap wings

E - pick up small items and Doombas

Tab - Inventory (including items you picked up with your beak)

Mouse click - toss picked up items and Doombas


## Enemies:
Doombas - dumb, harmless, can spread liquids over the floor

Sharks with frikkin lazer beams - chill until distubed, shoot lazers. Can bleed

Terminators dynamics - trigger happy, territorial, hate being pushed


## Todo list:

- Step on the blood/oil pools to soak your feet and paint the floor

- Pick up Doombas and dip/toss them into blood/oil pools for the same effect

- Pick up vases and toss them to break

- Dodge lasers and bullets to break more stuff or even kill opponents

- Toss vases at sharks and terminators to create even more pools

- Ultimately piss off the AI
